This repo consist of all the files related to my experiments which I accomplished using Arduino 33 BLE Sense powered by TFLite for microcontrollers.

This project was able to come into existence due to the knowledge I received from  
"Pete Warden Tutorial - Building a Magic Wand delivered at Tiny Ml Summit 2021." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKRdQHO7tIY]
